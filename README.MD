# Sezzle Calculator App

Live [here](https://sezzle-calc-app.herokuapp.com/).

## Summary

I used SSE because it's super simple. I probably would have used Sockets for something non-trivial or if I could have devoted more than a couple of hours.
I appreciate that the lag is pretty significant on power up because this is
the free Heroku tier.
